    <p>For comparison you can download the output of Q1 below.</p>

    <p>There can be many valid reasons why your results may differ slightly. </p>
    <p>
    <ul class="">
        <li>Rounding or different number types in different programming languages</li>
        <li>Slightly different windowing semantics provided by the event processing framework</li>
        <li>When data is partitioned, (e.g., to use multithreading) and the watermark is determined within a partition</li>
        <li>Slightly different geolocation lookup, e.g., handling of edge cases like point exactly on line or taking earth curvature into account. Also here some frameworks provide extensions which are slightly different.</li>
        <li>Other reasons</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>We acknowledge that your results may be slightly off. Since the ranking is based on 5 days average those difference should nevertheless not make that huge difference in the end.</p>
    <p>The configuration for the test is a follows: benchmark_type="test", batch_size=10k.</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
benchmarkconfiguration = ch.BenchmarkConfiguration(token="checkyourprofile",
                                                   batch_size=10_000,
                                                   benchmark_name="shows_up_in_dashboard",
                                                   benchmark_type="test",
                                                   queries=[ch.BenchmarkConfiguration.Query.Q1, ch.BenchmarkConfiguration.Query.Q2])

    <p>The snapshots are taken every batch, 10000, 20000 ... 160000</p>
